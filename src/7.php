    $problem1 = "What is the value of x in the equation 2x + 5 = 11?";
    $solution1 = "The value of x is 3.";

    $problem2 = "Simplify the expression: (x + 3) * (x - 3)";
    $solution2 = "The simplified expression is x^2 - 6x.";

    $problem3 = "Solve for x in the equation: 2x - 5 = 11";
    $solution3 = "To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation, which gives us 2x = 16. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = 8.";

    $problem4 = "Find the value of y in the equation: y = mx + b, where m = 2 and b = -3";
    $solution4 = "To find the value of y for a given x-value, we can substitute the values of m and b into the equation. For example, if we want to find the value of y for x = 4, we would substitute m = 2 and b = -3 into the equation to get y = 2x + (-3) = 8 - 3 = 5.";

    $problem5 = "Solve the system of equations: x + y = 4, x - 2y = 2";
    $solution5 = "To solve this system of equations, we can first add x to both sides of the second equation to get x - 2y = 2 + x. Then, we can subtract x from both sides of the second equation to get -x + 2y = 0. Next, we can divide both sides of the second equation by 2y to get -1 = 0. This means that y = 0, so x + y = 4 becomes x = 4. Finally, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find x.";

    $problem6 = "Find the equation of a line given the slope and y-intercept: m = 2 and b = -3";
    $solution6 = "To find the equation of a line given the slope and y-intercept, we can use the point-slope form of the line. The point-slope form of a line is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where (x1, y1) is a point on the line and m is the slope of the line. In this case, the slope is 2 and the y-intercept is -3, so the equation of the line is y - (-3) = 2(x - (-3)). Simplifying this equation gives us y + 3 = 2x.";

    $problem7 = "Find the equation of a circle given its center and radius: (1, 2) and r = 3";
    $solution7 = "To find the equation of a circle given its center and radius, we can use the formula for a circle with a center point (x0, y0) and radius r: (x - x0)^2 + (y - y0)^2 = r^2. In this case, the center point is (1, 2) and the radius is 3, so the equation of the circle is (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 9.";

    $problem8 = "Find the equation of a parabola given its vertex and axis: v = (4, 5) and a = x";
    $solution8 = "To find the equation of a parabola given its vertex and axis, we can use the vertex form of the parabola. The vertex form of a parabola is y = ax^2 + bx + c, where (a, b, c) are the coefficients of the parabola. In this case, the vertex point is (4, 5), so we have y = x(4)(x - 4) + 5 = 4x^2 - 8x + 9.";

    $problem9 = "Find the equation of a hyperbola given its asymptotes: x = 0 and y = 0";
    $solution9 = "To find the equation of a hyperbola given its asymptotes, we can use the equation for a hyperbola with two asymptotes. The equation for a hyperbola with two asymptotes is (ax^2 + by^2) / (2c) = 1, where (a, b, c) are the coefficients of the hyperbola. In this case, the asymptotes are x = 0 and y = 0, so we have (x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = 1.";

    $problem10 = "Find the equation of a quadric given its vertices: (0, 0), (4, 3), and (6, 0)";
    $solution10 = "To find the equation of a quadric given its vertices, we can use the equation for a quadric given three points. The equation for a quadric given three points is (x - x1)(x - x2)(x - x3) = 0, where (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) are the vertices of the quadric. In this case, the vertices are (0, 0), (4, 3), and (6, 0), so we have (x - 0)(x - 4)(x - 6) = 0.";

    $problem11 = "Find the equation of a quartic given its roots: r1 = 2, r2 = -3, r3 = 1/2, and r4 = -1";
    $solution11 = "To find the equation of a quartic given its roots, we can use the Newton-Girard formula. The Newton-Girard formula is x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0, where p, q, r, and s are the coefficients of the quartic equation. In this case, the roots are 2, -3, 1/2, and -1, so we have x^4 + 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 1/2x - (-1) = 0.";

    $problem12 = "Find the equation of a cubic given its vertex and asymptote: v = (2, 3) and y = 0";
    $solution12 = "To find the equation of a cubic given its vertex and asymptote, we can use the vertex-asymptote form of the cubic. The vertex-asymptote form of a cubic is y = ax^3 + bx^2 - 2ax + c, where (a, b, c) are the coefficients of the cubic. In this case, the vertex point is (2, 3), so we have y = x(2)(x - 2) + 3 = 6x^2 - 12x + 9.";

    $problem13 = "Find the equation of a parabola given its vertex and axis: v = (4, 5) and x";
    $solution13 = "To find the equation of a parabola given its vertex and axis, we can use the vertex form of the parabola. The vertex form of a parabola is y = ax^2 + bx + c, where (a, b, c) are the coefficients of the parabola. In this case, the vertex point is (4, 5), so we have y = x(4)(x - 4) + 5 = 4x^2 - 8x + 9.";

    $problem14 = "Find the equation of a circle given its center and radius: (1, 2) and r = 3";
    $solution14 = "To find the equation of a circle given its center and radius, we can use the formula for a circle with a center point (x0, y0) and radius r. The formula is (x - x0)^2 + (y - y0)^2 = r^2. In this case, the center point is (1, 2), so we have (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 9.";

    $problem15 = "Find the equation of a line given its slope and y-intercept: m = 2 and b = -3";
    $solution15 = "To find the equation of a line given its slope and y-intercept, we can use the slope-intercept form. The slope-intercept form is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. In this case, the slope is 2 and the y-intercept is -3, so we have y = 2x - 3.";
